## Unit 1

`comely`
:   A <u>comely</u> woman is attractive.

Virtue is like a rich stone, best plain set: and surely virtue is best in a body that is <u>comely</u>, though not of delicate features: and that hath rather dignity of presence, than beauty of aspect.

`err`
:   If you <u>err</u>, you make a mistake.

Neither is it almost seen, that very beautiful persons are otherwise of great virtue; as if nature were rather busy not to <u>err</u>, than in labour to produce excellency.

`decent`
:   <u>Decent</u> is used to describe something which is morally correct or acceptable.

`gracious`
:   If you describe the behaviour of someone in a position of authority as <u>gracious</u>, you mean that they behave in a polite and considerate way.

In beauty, that of favour is more than that of colour, and that of <u>decent</u> and <u>gracious</u> motion, more than that of favour.

`hath`
:   <u>Hath</u> is an old-fashioned third person singular form of the verb 'have'.

There is no excellent beauty, that <u>hath</u> not some strangeness in the proportion.

`trifle`
:   A <u>trifle</u> is something that is considered to have little importance, value, or significance.

A man cannot tell, whether Apelles, or Albert Durer, were the more <u>trifler</u>.

`whereof`
:   of what or of which

`geometrical`
:   Geometric or <u>geometrical</u> patterns or shapes consist of regular shapes or lines.

<u>Whereof</u> the one would make a personage by <u>geometrical</u> proportions: the other, by taking the best parts out of divers faces,to make one excellent.

`felicity`
:   <u>Felicity</u> is the quality of being good, pleasant, or desirable.

`maketh` 
:   ä½¿

But he must do it, by a kind of <u>felicity</u> (as a musician that <u>maketh</u> an excellent air in music) and not by rule.

`amiable` 
:   Someone who is <u>amiable</u> is friendly and pleasant to be with.

If it be true,that the principal part of beauty is in decent motion, certainly it is no marvel though persons in years seem many times more <u>amiable</u>.

`corrupt`
:   To <u>corrupt</u> someone means to cause them to stop caring about moral standards.

`dissolute`
:   Someone who is <u>dissolute</u> does not care at all about morals and lives in a way that is considered to be wicked and immoral.

`countenance`
:   Someone's <u>countenance</u> is their face.

Beauty is as summer fruits, which are easy to <u>corrupt</u>, and cannot last and, for the most part, it makes a <u>dissolute</u> youth, and an age a little out of <u>countenance</u>.

`blush`
:   When you <u>blush</u>, your face becomes redder than usual because you are ashamed or embarrassed.

But yet certainly again, if it light well, it maketh virtues shine, and vices <u>blush</u>.
